      {"para": "As a Bachelor of Game Art Graduate from Full Sail University I am looking to begin my lifelong aspiration of creating stunning art for video games. I am a self-starter focused on continuing to learn new tools, techniques, trends, and processes in the gaming industry community. I have a great eye for detail and can visualize scenes and models in three-dimensions before I start creating. I am looking to build unique experiences with professional teams through collaboration and contribute with fresh ideas."},
      {"para": "As a freelancing 3D artist I have worked on several projects post graduation. These projects helped me to push my skills even farther as I have done quite a bit of learning on the fly. Learning new practices and techniques is a processes that I thoroughly enjoy. I subscribe to multiple CG newsletters so I can be on the lookout for that next webinar that will take me to the next level. I am a hard worker who is ready to establish myself as an industry professional."}
